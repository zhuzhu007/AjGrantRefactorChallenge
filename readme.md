# Coding Challenge

Thanks for taking the time to download this refactoring exercise. Remember that refactoring is normally an iterative process and we would not expect perfection in a single pull request.

This solution contains three classes used by our imaginary sales department to produce order receipts and some unit tests to prove that everything works.

Pretend this code is part of a larger software system and one of the other developers on your team has submitted this code. 

Assume that this solution will change regularly as a result of fast moving product requirements. Aspects of the system that are likely to change include: 

 - More policies at new prices.
 - Different discount codes and percentages.
 - Additional receipt formats.

As a developer in the team:

- Prepare a code review document listing the points that you would like to address with the developer.
- Refactor the code so that it can survive an onslaught of change, you're confident it works, and you're comfortable the next engineer will easily understand how to work on it.
- Create a pull request for your changes (no direct commits to `main` or `develop` branch).

*Hints: 
- If there are multiple commits we will read each of them to gain insight into how you went about tackling the refactoring
- Consider your approach carefully before you start and try to include your reasoning in the review document. This is a great way to demonstrate your approach should you run out of time. 


If we love your refactoring and your resume is legit, we'll move to the next step of the recruitment process.

We recommend that you set aside about 2 hours for this challenge. 

**Show us what you can do! You should be proud of what you submit.**
